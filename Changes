    - Implement pm_exit().
    
0.22 Sun, Aug. 24th, 2014

    - Fix RT#83636 by correctly importing the Config module.

0.20 Mon. Feb. 25, 2013
    - Use Config to find perl to run RT#69473

0.19 Wed. Oct. 5, 2011
    - Fix tests to not fail when MooseX::NonMoose
      isn't installed.
    - exit 0 without writing a Makefile.PL rather than dieing
      with an error code. exit(0) preferred by the toolchain.
    - Add FCGI::Engine::ProcManager::Constrained subclass to manage
      restarting children on over-memory or after a certtain number
      of requests.

0.18 Mon. Nov. 15, 2010
    - fixing the plack -E flag (it changed)
    - changing plackup usage to --daemonize
      instead of --detach (it is more useful
      this way)
    - changing plackup usage to --pid instead
      of --pidfile (also more useful this way)
    - added optional --workers to plackup server
      manager as an alternate to --nproc. this
      makes it possible to use it with Starman,
      and other plack backends too.

      (^^ all these changes above thanks to bricas)

    - Fix bug: Exiting subroutine via next in
      ProcManager (fixed by Johannes Plunien)

      - updated FCGI::Engine::PSGI to more closely
        follow what is in Plack::Handler::FCGI

0.14 Mon. Feb. 22, 2010
    - updating copyright on all files
