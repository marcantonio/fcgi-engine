=head1 NAME

FCGI::Engine::Manager::Server::FreeBSD6 - A subclass of FCGI::Engine::Manager::Server specific to FreeBSD 6.*

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This may not even be needed anymore, but at one time it was. This works 
around the fact that L<FCGI::ProcManager> didn't like to be dameonized
on FreeBSD 6.*. I suspect that now that I have switched this to use 
L<FCGI::Engine::ProcManager> that it is no longer an issue. But at this 
point I have not have the opportunity to test this theory, so I am 
leaving this here for historical purposes and as an example of subclassing
L<FCGI::Engine::Manager::Server>.

=head1 BUGS
