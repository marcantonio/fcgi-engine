=head1 NAME

FCGI::Engine::Manager::Server - An abstraction to represent a single FCGI::Engine server

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Nothing here to see really, this just models the individual server 
information in the config file for FCGI::Engine::Manager. It also 
handles creating the command line as well. 

=head1 BUGS

All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug
to cpan-RT.
